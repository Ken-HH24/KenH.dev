Maintainers from several popular frameworks have chosen Vite as their recommended build tool, and are now deeply involved in Vite core development, participating in discussions and directly working on fixes and features. Vite exposes a flexible <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-v-c417d329>JavaScript API</a>, allowing integrations with backend frameworks like <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-v-c417d329>Rails</a> and <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-v-c417d329>Laravel</a>, or other dev tools like <a href="#cypress" data-v-c417d329>Cypress</a> and <a href="#storybook" data-v-c417d329>Storybook</a>. Vite plugins API is compatible with Rollup, enabling Vite to leverage the Rollup plugins ecosystem.
