## About me

My name is Ken. I graduated in 2022 and joined an internet company as a frontend engineer.

At the first 2 years of my career my major job is building a HCM(Human Capital Management) system. Now I join a team which builds some short videos apps.

My current focus is on improving myself on other aspects such as system design, backend knowledge, trying to build interesting products.
